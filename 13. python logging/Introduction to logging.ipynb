    "Logging is a crucial tool for tracking the execution of a program, diagnosing issues, and maintaining system stability. It provides a way to capture and store messages about events occurring within an application. Logging helps developers and system administrators monitor behavior, debug problems, and gain insights into software performance.\n",

    "#### Why Use Logging?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helps diagnose and debug errors efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provides a record of events that occurred during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allows tracking of warnings, errors, and critical issues.\n",
    "\n",
